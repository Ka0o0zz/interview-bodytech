I use the new state management library created by facebook's engineers: [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/).

The project is build with [React.Js](https://reactjs.org/) using  [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

In order to look the songs we call some Spotify endpoints available on their [Docs for developers](https://developer.spotify.com/).


### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Set environment variables

you can replace the spotify credentials with your own
